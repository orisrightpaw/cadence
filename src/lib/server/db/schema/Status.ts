/*
    Why not just consolidate Status + Activity into one schema?

    Data fetching! It's very important! It's gotta be fast,
    or else your users will be stuck waiting for their page 
    to load. We can keep a copy of the Activity, and have a 
    Status too, so we can fufill other requests relating
    to the Status, as well. Might not be the best solution.
    I'll probably think of a better one. Maybe not at 1:30 AM.
